# What is still missing

This is the reference inventory of everything this port does not have yet, so a later session does
not have to rediscover it. It is deliberately separate from [BRING_UP_CHECKLIST.md](BRING_UP_CHECKLIST.md):
the checklist is *how to test or bring up* a feature, this is *what is not there yet*.

Status words used below:

- **in tree** - the code, device tree and packaging are in this repository; it may still be untested
  on the phone (the hardware status is called out separately).
- **untested** - in tree, but nothing has run it on the phone yet. The test commands are linked.
- **missing** - no code exists in the port (or mainline) for it.
- **blocked** - a prerequisite outside this repository is needed.
- **deferred** - the user asked to leave it until the camera, connectivity and sensors are done.

Everything is eMMC: the stock cmdline says `sprdboot.flash=emmc` and the storage is on `sdio3`
(`NOTES.md`). The X6525 also shipped in a UFS variant; this port and its U-Boot have no UFS support,
so it does not boot there. That is a hardware-variant limitation, not an unfinished driver.

## Camera

| Part | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Rear Samsung S5K3L6 (slot 0) | in tree, untested | `drivers/media/i2c/s5k3l6.c` (kernel patch 0014), node on i2c1 0x2d and the 4-lane camsys port (0015). Vendor register tables, 24 MHz, 4 lanes, RAW10. Needs frames, not just a probe - see checklist 5.1. |
| Front OmniVision OV8856 (slot 1) | in tree, untested | Mainline `ov8856` driver, node on i2c0 0x10, 2-lane M port (kernel patch 0020). Runs at 19.2 MHz because the mainline driver has no 24 MHz tables; the vendor library uses 24 MHz. Power-down (ap_gpio 46) is held low by a gpio-hog because the driver has no power-down support. |
| Flash (OCP8137 / AW36515) | missing | The live tree has both at i2c5 0x63/0x64, torch/preflash/highlight on ap_gpio 32/138/139 and sync on 121. No mainline driver, so no torch and no flash for stills. |
| VCM / autofocus | missing | The front socket also has `vddcammot`; the rear lens's focus motor has no mainline driver in this tree. Fixed-focus until then. |
| Camera EEPROM/OTP | missing | The unit's `/mnt/vendor/productinfo/otpdata` is empty, so there is no calibration data to read for this unit anyway. |
| Camera userspace | missing | The mainline sprd stack exposes raw Bayer and the ISP blocks over V4L2, but there is no libcamera pipeline handler, no 3A and no application. First milestone is raw frames; a usable camera is a userspace project. |
| Second rear lens | not applicable | Slot 2 reports `fakeserial`: it is a decorative lens. `sensor-main2` in the live tree is the fake serial device, not a sensor. |

## Connectivity

| Part | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Wi-Fi | in tree, hardware-tested per checklist 2 | Mainline `sc23xx_wlan` + `sprd_wcn`; `wcnmodem.bin`, `wifi_board_config.bin` packaged. |
| Bluetooth | in tree, untested after patch 0013 | `btsprdsipc` and the two config blobs are packaged. The U-Boot environment now reads `btmac.txt` and `wifimac.txt` from the eMMC `prodnv` partition (commit `6d24704`), so the BD address can be this unit's own; if those files are absent the loads fail and patch 0013's random locally-administered address is used instead, as before. Neither path has been exercised on hardware yet. |
| GNSS | in tree, untested | `gnssmodem.bin` packaged; `sprd_wcn` GNSS child, `drivers/gnss/sprd.c`, `/dev/gnss0`. The `pm_gnss` SIPC channel lives under pmsys, so the pmsys co-processor has to run: `pm_bootcode.bin` is now packaged (firmware pkgrel 6) and `x6525-pmsys.service` copies `pm_sys.bin` out of `pm_sys_a` at boot. No gpsd/geoclue is installed by default. |
| Cellular modem | in tree, never brought up | `sprd_modem` and the six images exist; `x6525-modem-nv.service` extracts them from the unit's own partitions (the NV carries the IMEI and is not published). What is unknown is whether the Unisoc LTE stack initialises on mainline at all: SIM rails are not described in the DT, and no modem has reached `running` yet. |
| BC1.2 / charger type detection | missing | The SC2730 does the detection in the stock stack (`sprd_bc1p2`); mainline has no driver. A VBUS GPIO supply is used instead, so charging is limited to 500 mA. |
| FM radio | missing | The WCN SIPC has an `fm` channel, but there is no mainline FM driver or userspace. |
| NFC | not fitted | The live tree has a `sec-nfc@27` node on i2c2, but this unit's hardware list does not show an NFC part in use. Treat as absent. |

## Sensors

| Part | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Sensor hub (accelerometer, magnetometer, light and proximity, virtual gyro) | in tree, untested | Mainline `sprd_shub` and the five IIO drivers are `=m`. They bind to the `pm_shub` SIPC channel, which needs pmsys running - the same service as GNSS. The pmsys image's own strings name the parts it drives: **SC7A20E** accelerometer, **MMC5603** magnetometer and **LS9801** light/proximity, plus a **virtual gyro** (there is no physical gyro). Calibration data from the stock `persist` partition is not wired up. |
| VL53L0X time-of-flight | in tree, unverified | Node on i2c4, `st,vl53l0x`, `reg = <0x29>`, XSHUT ap_gpio 168, interrupt 169. The stock node used reg 0x52 (its 8-bit form) and a vendor driver; if the part does not probe, the address and XSHUT sequencing are the first suspects. |
| Fingerprint | missing | The stock system binds a Goodix sensor (`gf-keys`). There is no mainline driver for it, and none is planned here. |
| Thermal zones | in tree | `board-thermal`, `pa-thermal`, `chg-thermal` with the stock NTC tables; no trips or polling, matching the stock zones. |

## Storage, display, audio, USB and power

- **Storage**: eMMC root and the microSD slot work; the eMMC write cache is disabled at boot
  (`x6525-emmc-cacheoff.service`) because the unit loses power uncleanly. UFS is not supported (see
  the top of this file). eMMC/SD PHY timing has not been tuned beyond what the bootloader leaves.
- **Display**: the TD4160 HX panel driver exposes 60.03 Hz and 90.05 Hz modes (the 90 Hz mode is
  patch 0019 and has not been selected on the phone yet). Brightness is DCS, not PWM. The panel
  reset polarity is the first suspect if a future panel stays dark.
- **Audio**: the SC2730 codec and the speaker amp (`ap_gpio 113`) are described; playback is the
  current path. Voice-call audio depends on the modem and is untested. Headset detection/mic routing
  is not described on mainline.
- **USB**: networking (the login path) is in tree. OTG host mode now has the bq2415x boost as a
  `vbus-supply` (patches 0016/0017) but has not been tested with a keyboard/stick. The stock system's
  "unknown USB mode" notification is not a mainline message; if the port shows a similar problem,
  the Type-C/role-switch path is where to look. USB PD is present through `sc27xx_pd`/`tcpm`, but
  only the charger role has been exercised.
- **Charging**: bq24158 driver, VBUS detection, the USB-detection supply, and the charger-enable hog
  are in tree. JEITA tables and BC1.2 are not. Charging current is capped at 500 mA until BC1.2.

## Performance and the storage variant

**In tree now:**

- **CPU DVFS** - `sprd-cpufreq-v2` with the chip's own DVFS bins from the NVMEM cells, enabled in the
  board DTS (`&cpufreq { sprd,soc-version = <0x36303654>; status = "okay"; }`).
- **CPU thermal throttling** - the SoC's `cputop0`/`ank*` zones already have 70 C passive trips and
  cpufreq cooling maps in the mainline dtsi.
- **GPU thermal throttling** - patch 0021 gives the `gpu-thermal` zone a 70 C passive trip and a
  devfreq cooling map to `&gpu` (Panfrost registers the cooling device). Before this the zone only
  reported; the GPU never throttled.
- **Storage PHY delays** - the board DTS carries the stock values for eMMC (HS/HS200/HS400/ES) and
  microSD (legacy/HS/SDR50/SDR104).
- **HS200/HS400 test knob** - patch 0022 adds `sdhci_sprd.enable_hs200=1`; see the test below.

**Still open:**

- **GPU 850 MHz** - the stock OPP table has 850 MHz @ 0.8 V, but the mainline composite GPU clock
  does not propagate rate requests to its parents (`sprd_comp_determine_rate()` passes flags 0), so
  GPLL stays at its 750 MHz default. GPLL also feeds the aux clocks through `/20`
  (`gpll_42m5` -> aux0/1/2/probe), so reprogramming it for the GPU changes those rates unless the
  clock tree is reworked. The OPP table stops at 768 MHz until that is solved and tested.
- **eMMC link speed** - `sdhci_sprd_pdata` sets `SDHCI_QUIRK2_BROKEN_HS200` for every r11
  controller, so the core clears `MMC_CAP2_HS200` and the link stays at DDR52 (HS400 is gated behind
  HS200), although the stock kernel runs this part at HS400. The opt-in knob exists to test whether
  the quirk is unnecessary on UMS9230; if it is, the quirk should be narrowed by compatible (and the
  knob removed) after it has run on hardware. The eMMC is the root filesystem, so this is
  deliberately not the default.
- **Suspend/resume** - the firmware's PSCI is 0.2 (`compatible = "arm,psci-0.2"`), which has no
  SYSTEM_SUSPEND; the vendor suspends through the PM co-processor, not PSCI. CPU idle
  (core power-down, `arm,psci-suspend-param = <0x10000>`) works. `systemctl suspend` is therefore
  expected to fail or only freeze; s2ram needs a pmsys suspend driver that does not exist yet.

**UFS (the other storage variant):** not fitted on this eMMC unit, and the stock tree disables its
`ufs@20200000` node too. The mainline kernel already builds `CONFIG_SCSI_UFS_SPRD=y` and the dtsi
has the node disabled; the reeder enables it with `vcc-supply = <&vddemmccore>`. To support a UFS
unit, U-Boot needs `CMD_UFS`/`SCSI`/`UFS`/`UFS_SPRD_UMS9230` back in its defconfig, the board DTS
needs the UFS node enabled (and the eMMC node likely disabled), and the bootcmd must scan `scsi` as
well as `mmc`. None of that can be tested here, and enabling it unconditionally on an eMMC unit
would share `vddemmccore` with the rootfs device, so it stays off.

## Upstreaming

- The kernel series (now 22 patches in `patches/upstream/`) is cut against the
  `v7.2-rc6-ums9230-0` tag and has not been sent. Patch 22 is explicitly not for submission. The
  two U-Boot patches have not been sent either. `NOTES.md` explains where each series should go
  (kernel: maintainer by mail/issue, not a PR against the stale branch; U-Boot: PR from the fork
  branch).
- The fork branches in `NOTES.md` are force-updated when the series changes, so
  `git format-patch` from them remains the source of truth for the patch files.

## Hardware-test queue

In the order the current work needs them:

1. **Camera** - both sensors probe, then raw frames:
   `dmesg | grep -iE 's5k3l6|ov8856|camsys'`, `media-ctl -p`, `v4l2-ctl --list-devices`, then the
   test-pattern and stream commands in checklist 5.1.
2. **pmsys, GNSS and the sensor hub** - `journalctl -u x6525-pmsys`, `cat /sys/class/remoteproc/*/state`,
   `ls -l /dev/gnss0`, `ls /sys/bus/iio/devices`, then `gpsd -n /dev/gnss0` outdoors (checklist 5.3).
3. **OTG host** - a keyboard or stick on the port, `dmesg | grep -i usb`, `lsusb`
   (checklist 4.5).
4. **Cellular** - `mmcli -L`, `mmcli -m any`, the remoteproc state and the service log
   (checklist 5.2).
5. **90 Hz** - `modetest -M sprd-drm` / the compositor's refresh-rate setting (checklist 3.0).
6. **MACs** - `printenv bdaddr wifiaddr` at the U-Boot prompt, then `ip link` and
   `bluetoothctl show` on pmOS; if the variables are empty, check the `prodnv` files (checklist 2.1).
7. **Performance** - the GPU thermal trip and cooling device, the HS200 opt-in test, and the
   suspend expectations (checklist 7.1-7.3).
